# 🐍 Snake Appearance Issue - FIXED!

## 🚨 The Problem
Your snake wasn't appearing on the board when running:
```bash
java -jar ../lib/SnakeRunner.jar -j MyAgent.jar
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that the **JAR file wasn't properly created** after the latest code changes. Here's what happened:

1. **Missing JAR File**: The `MyAgent.jar` file didn't exist in the src directory
2. **Stale Compilation**: The class files were outdated after our anti-self-trap upgrades
3. **PowerShell Escaping**: The JAR creation command had PowerShell character escaping issues

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Step 1: Recompilation
```bash
javac -cp ".;../lib/SnakeRunner.jar" MyAgent.java
```
- Ensured all the latest anti-self-trap code was compiled
- Generated fresh .class files with all the new methods

### Step 2: Proper JAR Creation
```bash
jar cfm MyAgent.jar manifest.txt MyAgent.class MyAgent`$Point.class MyAgent`$Snake.class
```
- Used PowerShell backtick escaping for the `$` characters
- Included all required inner classes (Point and Snake)
- Used the correct manifest file

### Step 3: Verification
```bash
jar tf MyAgent.jar
```
Confirmed the JAR contains:
- ✅ META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
- ✅ MyAgent.class  
- ✅ MyAgent$Point.class
- ✅ MyAgent$Snake.class

## 🎯 Testing Results
- ✅ **JAR Mode**: `java -jar ../lib/SnakeRunner.jar -j MyAgent.jar` - **WORKING**
- ✅ **Agent Mode**: `java -jar ../lib/SnakeRunner.jar -a MyAgent.jar` - **WORKING**
- ✅ **Snake Appears**: Snake now properly appears on the board
- ✅ **Anti-Self-Trap Features**: All the latest survival improvements are active

## 🛠️ What's Now Working

Your enhanced Snake AI is now fully operational with:

### 🛡️ Self-Trap Prevention
